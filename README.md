# Effective-Modern-Cpp

A summary of Scott Meyers' classic "Effective Modern C++"

## Objective
The book is awesome and should be read by every C++ developer. I'd like to put a summary here so that every developer can revise it before they go to bed.

If you have a whole week vocation, buy the [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033707.do) and read it thoroughly!

## Summary

1. Deducing Types

    Item 1:  Understand template type deduction.

    Item 2:  Understand auto type deduction.

    Item 3:  Understand decltype.

    Item 4:  Know how to view deduced types.

2. auto

    Item 5:  Prefer auto to explicit type declarations.

    Item 6:  Use the explicitly typed initializer idiom when auto deduces undesired types.

3. Moving to Modern C++

    Item 7:  Distinguish between () and {} when creating objects.

    Item 8: Prefer nullptr to 0 and NULL.

    Item 9:  Prefer alias declarations to typedefs.

    Item 10:  Prefer scoped enums to unscoped enums.

    Item 11:  Prefer deleted functions to private undefined ones.

    Item 12:  Declare overriding functions override.

    Item 13:  Prefer const_iterators to iterators.

    Item 14:  Declare functions noexcept if they wonâ€™t emit exceptions.

    Item 15:  Use constexpr whenever possible.

    Item 16:  Make const member functions thread safe.

    Item 17:  Understand special member function generation.

4. Smart Pointers

    Item 18:  Use std::unique_ptr for exclusive-ownership resource management.

    Item 19:  Use std::shared_ptr for shared-ownership resource management.

    Item 20:  Use std::weak_ptr for std::shared_ptr-like pointers that can dangle.

    Item 21:  Prefer std::make_unique and std::make_shared to direct use of new.

    Item 22:  When using the Pimpl Idiom, define special member functions in the implementation file.

5. Rvalue References, Move Semantics, and Perfect Forwarding

    Item 23:  Understand std::move and std::forward.

    Item 24:  Distinguish universal references from rvalue references.

    Item 25:  Use std::move on rvalue references, std::forward on universal references.

    Item 26:  Avoid overloading on universal references.

    Item 27:  Familiarize yourself with alternatives to overloading on universal references.

    Item 28:  Understand reference collapsing.

    Item 29:  Assume that move operations are not present, not cheap, and not used.

    Item 30:  Familiarize yourself with perfect forwarding failure cases.

6. Lambda Expressions

    Item 31:  Avoid default capture modes.

    Item 32:  Use init capture to move objects into closures.

    Item 33:  Use decltype on auto&& parameters to std::forward them.

    Item 34:  Prefer lambdas to std::bind.

7. The Concurrency API

    Item 35:  Prefer task-based programming to thread-based.

    Item 36:  Specify std::launch::async if asynchronicity is essential.

    Item 37:  Make std::threads unjoinable on all paths.

    Item 38:  Be aware of varying thread handle destructor behavior.

    Item 39:  Consider void futures for one-shot event communication.

    Item 40:  Use std::atomic for concurrency, volatile for special memory.

8. Tweaks

    Item 41:  Consider pass by value for copyable parameters that are cheap to move and always copied.

    Item 42:  Consider emplacement instead of insertion.
